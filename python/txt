When closing a shell all running jobs will recieve a SIGHUP, causing them to exit.
You can use `nohup` to avoid that, here's an example:

`bigsleep.py`
```python
import time

while (True):
    print("Big sleep.")
    time.sleep(1)
```

`wrapper`
```bash
#!/bin/bash

nohup pipenv run python ./bigsleep.py > /dev/null 2>&1 &
```
